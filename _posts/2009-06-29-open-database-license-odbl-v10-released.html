<p>We are delighted to announce the release of v1.0 of the Open Database License (ODbL):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/</a></p>
<p>The Open Database License (ODbL) is an <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">open</a> license for data and databases which includes explicit attribution and share-alike requirements.</p>
<p>This license, the first of its kind, is a major step forward for open data. There are currently very few licenses available suited to data and databases and none which provide for share-alike (existing share-alike licenses such as the GPL, GFDL and CC By-SA are all unsuitable for data).</p>
<p>The development of the ODbL, has been a major effort extending over more than one and half years with an intensive consultation and review period for the last 6 months. We'd like to express our thanks to the communities and individuals who have contributed during this time.</p>
