<p>Creative Commons has released the beta version of CCZero (or CC ∅). CCZero implements the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/" title="Science Commons home">Science Commons</a> <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/" title="Science Commons protocol">Protocol for implementing Open Access Data</a> by waiving related intellectual property rights, including copyright and unfair competition. Open Data Commons also implements this protocol in the Public Domain Dedication and Licence with the accompanying Community Norms statement.</p>
<p>The homepage for the licensing tool is at:<br />
<a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/license/zero" title="CC Zero homepage">http://labs.creativecommons.org/license/zero </a></p>
<p>There are actually two underlying CCZero legal tools: one <em>waives</em> copyright and related rights and the other <em>asserts</em> that the work has no copyright in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>CC ∅ Waiver 1.0 United States</strong></p>
<p>Human readable summary available <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/licenses/zero-waive/1.0/us/" title="CC Zero human readable summary">here</a>.<br />
Underlying legal code available <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/licenses/zero-waive/1.0/us/legalcode" title="CCZero waiver language">here</a>.</p>
<p>This legal code is for authors and rightsholder to waive copyright and related rights to the covered work and thus place it into the public domain. It is geared towards the law of the United States and <strike>does not mention, for example, database rights</strike>UPDATE see below. It has a back-up license (like the <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/odc-public-domain-dedication-and-licence/" title="PDDL text">Public Domain Dedication and Licence</a>) in case a court finds the wiaver invalid.</p>
<p><strong>CC ∅ assertion 1.0 United States</strong></p>
<p>Human readable summary available <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/licenses/zero-assert/1.0/us/" title="CC Zero assertion human readable summary">here</a>.<br />
Underlying legal code available <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/licenses/zero-assert/1.0/us/legalcode" title="CC Zero assertion legal text">here</a>.</p>
<p>The assertion is for third parties (not authors or rightsholders) to say that they've looked into the copyright status of the work and believe it to be in the public domain -- in other words out of copyright.  The text limits the assertion to US law and includes a clause recognizing that the asserter may be liable for making this assertion.</p>
<p><strong>Initial thoughts </strong></p>
<p>I'll be posting more about CCZero and its relationship to the Open Data Commons but initially I'd like to point out that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strike>CCZero is based on US law and doesn't include a specific waiver of database rights, though further internationalisation will presumably result in versions that do waive database rights</strike>;</li>
<li>UPDATE -- Apologies I initially missed it, but there is language waiving database rights thought they aren't mentioned by name. The waiver states " including but not limited to ... and any rights protecting the extraction, dissemination and reuse of data ,.."</li>
<li>The assertion only covers copyright law and not other areas of law, including those covered by the waiver (privacy, moral rights, unfair competition, and so on), though this makes sense in the context of these other rights; and</li>
<li>The CCZero assertion only covers copyright law in the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence and the CCZero texts are drafts, and so your comments would be most welcome.</p>
