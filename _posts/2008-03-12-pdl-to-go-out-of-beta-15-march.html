<p>At the Open Knowledge Convention in London on Saturday, March 15th, I will make a short presentation on the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence and announce its release out of beta. By the end of the day on Monday I will have all the changes finished and up on OpenDataCommons.org.  A detailed FAQ will still be in the works, as this project at the moment is volunteer led.  If you'd like to contribute a FAQ or to financially support the development of a FAQ and additional materials, please contact support ]at[ this site's name.org. Thanks!</p>
