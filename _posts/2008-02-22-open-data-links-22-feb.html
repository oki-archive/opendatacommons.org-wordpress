<p>Some things I've been reading that should be of interest.  There is a great deal more that I'll put up soon.</p>
<p>Read the history of open data in Richard Poydner's "<a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2008/02/05/229273/peter-murray-rust-and-the-data-mining-robots.htm">Peter Murray-Rust and the data-mining robots</a>". Indeed, without Peter Murray-Rust, we wouldn't have the Open Data Commons project.</p>
<p>Speaking of Murray-Rust, you can listen to <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities/2007/05/peter_murrayrust_talks_with_ta.php">a Talking to Talis podcast with him</a> and <a href="http://poynder.blogspot.com/2008/01/open-access-interviews-peter-murray.html">read Richard Poynder's interview</a> with him.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.opencontentlawyer.com/2008/02/08/ocln-open-content-legal-news-8-feb-2008/">crossposted from opencontentlawyer</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Report on Ordnance Survey licensing practices.</strong> <a href="http://www.freeourdata.org.uk/">Free Our Data</a> <a href="http://www.freeourdata.org.uk/blog/?p=173">covers in this post</a> <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcomloc/268/26802.htm">the report from the Commons Select Committee on Communities and Local Government</a> looking into <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/">Ordnance Survey</a>â€™s licensing and business model.</p>
<p>Ordnance Survey is Britain's national mapping agency. Due to UK government works being able to have IP rights over their work, if OS or some other agency wants to make their work public domain, they'd need some tool such as the PDDL to do it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2008/02/07/science-commons-gets-its-15-minutes/">Podcast with John Wilbanks.</a> </strong>The head of Science Commons talks with Ellen Duranceau of <a href="http://news-libraries.mit.edu/">MIT Libraries News</a> about SC and <a href="http://opendatacommons.org">open data</a>.</p>
