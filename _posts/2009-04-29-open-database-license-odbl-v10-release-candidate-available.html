<p>The Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0 "Release Candidate" is now available at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/</a></p>
<p>This updated version of the license incorporates a whole set of changes arising out of the <a href="/2009/02/27/open-database-license-draft-available-for-comments/">earlier comments period</a> and the main changes are summarized below.</p>
<p>As the naming suggests, we believe this text is now very close to a "production-ready" 1.0 license. To allow interested individuals and communities time to review the latest set of changes, as well as to provide an opportunity to catch any last minute "bugs", there will be a <strong>1 week comment period</strong> starting today and ending at midnight next Wednesday (6th May). <strong>Full details on how to comment can be found on the <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">ODbL home page</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In preparation for the 1.0 release we have also prepared detailed instructions on how to apply the license which can also be found on the <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">ODbL home page</a>. Any feedback on these is also very welcome.</p>
<p>Finally, we'd like to take this opportunity to say a big thank-you to everyone who contributed to that process as well as a special thank-you to <a href="http://www.jordanhatcher.com/">Jordan Hatcher</a>, advisory board member and the person primarily responsible, not only for creating the original version of this license, but preparing this latest revision.</p>
<h3>Summary of Changes</h3>
<p>For the license, specific changes include:</p>
<ol>
<li>A variety of typos, grammar fixes and minor renaming</li>
<li>Change "Publicly Convey" to "Use" as Trigger for SA</li>
<li>Clarify "Publicly Convey"</li>
<li>Change from "Data" to "Contents" for contents of DB.</li>
<li>Introduction of proxy for specification of compatible licenses</li>
<li>Clarification of what is required when making available of derivatives</li>
<li>Reinstatement of terminated rights if breach ceases</li>
<li>Move "How To Apply" section to website (not strictly part of license)</li>
</ol>
<p>We have also prepared several <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/faq/licenses/">new FAQs</a> to address issues that were raised during the comment process, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choice of Law</li>
<li>Enforceability</li>
