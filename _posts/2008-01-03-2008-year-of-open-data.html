<p>After a short break for the holidays, we'll be posting and promoting the new drafts more regularly. I hope that everyone had a pleasant time over the holiday break. Happy new year!</p>
<p>2008 is looking like it will be the year of open data. With the release of the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/">Science Commons protocol</a>, the announcement of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Cczero">CCZero</a>, and of course our project, it looks like there will be quite a few options on the table for licensing data in an open way this year. This is after a long time where there were <em>no</em> good options for those looking at licensing data.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will soon release the draft Public Domain Dedication &amp; Licence for use and then we can start getting some feedback from projects making use of the licence and their experiences. With some early adopters, we can quickly start to see some of the benefits of the public domain approach, and maybe some variations on the Community Norms (you are after all free to roll your own).</p>
<p>We will be doing some speaking and presentations on open data throughout the year -- details as soon as they are available. One of many will be at this year's OKCON on 15th of March at the London School of Economics. Details <a href="https://blog.okfn.org/2007/12/06/open-knowledge-okcon-2008-lse-london-15th-march-2008/">here</a>. If you know of an event you think we should speak at about open data, please contact us with the details.</p>
