<blockquote>"It won't be long before open access is old hat, taken for granted by a new generation of tools and services that depend on unrestricted access to research literature and data. As those tools and services come along, they will be the hot story. But historians will note that they all depend on open access and that open access was not easily won."  Peter Suber</p>
<p>Free and libre/open source software (F/LOSS) movements have spawned similar solutions in many other contexts, each at differing stages of development. As F/LOSS enters the routine and familiarity of middle age, the open content movement--open source for non-software copyright and best embodied by the work of Creative Commons --has just graduated university and is getting a feel for the world. Even younger is the open data movement, whose legal tools have just started to come online.</p></blockquote>
<p>And with that, starts a new article I've written for the Open Source Business Resource, which is now available <a href="http://www.osbr.ca/ojs/index.php/osbr/issue/view/51">in the February issue</a>. <a href="http://www.osbr.ca/ojs/index.php/osbr/article/view/516/475">Implementing Open Data: The Open Data Commons Project</a></p>
