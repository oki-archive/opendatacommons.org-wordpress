<p>It may not look like it, but there has been some movement behind the scenes here at Open Data Commons. Lately, we've set some goals for restructuring the website and organisation behind the licences, so stay tuned for further updates. We'll soon have greater ways for people to participate, including areas for volunteers and contributors. Until then...</p>
