<p>We've started work on an ultra simple guide to assist people who want to make their data open:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/guide/">http://www.opendatacommons.org/guide/</a></p>
<p>We've been asked a lot recently for a simple HOWTO and this guide is one effort to address this.</p>
<p>This is a first draft and we'd really like to hear any <a href="/contact/">feedback</a> people have.</p>
