<h3>What is Open Data?</h3>
<p>Open data is data that anyone is free to use, reuse and redistribute without restriction (except, perhaps the requirements to attribute and sharealike). For precise details see <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">http://opendefinition.org/</a>.</p>
<h3>How Can I Make My Data Open?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make your data publicly available!
<ul>
<li>If your data isn't publicly available then you make it hard for others to use it (or even decide whether to use it).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apply a suitable open data license.
<ul>
<li>Explicit licensing is essential to provide clarity and certainty to users and reusers (and is needed even if you want your data to be 'public domain').</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>How Do I License My Data?</h3>
<p>Open Data Commons have already prepared a set of suitable licenses for you -- all you need to do is apply one. The 2 basic options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Domain: Apply the <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/">Public Domain Dedication and License</a>
<ul>
<li>Puts all your material in the 'Public Domain'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share-Alike (plus Attribution): Apply the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">Open Database License</a>
<ul>
<li>Like the GPL (or CC Attribution Share-Alike) requires public reusers of your data to share back changes (and attribute).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NB: even though both these licenses tend to mention "Databases" rather than "Data" they are entirely suited to "data" -- it is simply that in lawyers-speak the preferred term for a collection of information is "Database" rather than "data".</p>
<p>To apply the license you would add a statement such as the following to your data (or place it on the page where it is available):</p>
<h4>Public Domain Dedication and License</h4>
<blockquote><p>
  This {DATA(BASE)-NAME} is made available under the Public Domain Dedication and License version v1.0 whose full text can be found at <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/">http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>NB: you may also wish to apply some complementary <a href="/norms/">Community Norms</a></p>
<h4>Open Database License</h4>
<blockquote><p>
  This {DATA(BASE)-NAME} is made available under Open Database License whose full text can be found at <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/</a>. Any rights in individual contents of the database are licensed under the Database Contents License whose text can be found <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/">http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/</a>
</p></blockquote>
