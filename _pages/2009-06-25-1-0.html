<h2>ODC Open Database License (ODbL)</h2>
<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to<br />
allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while<br />
maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by<br />
copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some<br />
jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that<br />
cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,<br />
the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to<br />
act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.</p>
<p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,<br />
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),<br />
and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the<br />
contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL<br />
together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a<br />
single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the<br />
contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should<br />
describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual<br />
record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.</p>
<p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be<br />
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,<br />
trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights<br />
over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may<br />
have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing<br />
activities not covered by this License.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Licensor (as defined below)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You (as defined below)</p>
<p>agree as follows:</p>
<h3>1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words</h3>
<p>"Collective Database" – Means this Database in unmodified form as part<br />
of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are<br />
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective<br />
Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.</p>
<p>"Convey" – As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,<br />
or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables<br />
a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative<br />
Database.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a<br />
computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no<br />
transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.<br />
"Contents" – The contents of this Database, which includes the<br />
information, independent works, or other material collected into the<br />
Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual<br />
data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.</p>
<p>"Database" – A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a<br />
systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic<br />
or other means offered under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>"Database Directive" – Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European<br />
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection<br />
of databases, as amended or succeeded.</p>
<p>"Database Right" – Means rights resulting from the Chapter III ("sui<br />
generis") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed<br />
by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of<br />
the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar<br />
rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.</p>
<p>"Derivative Database" – Means a database based upon the Database, and<br />
includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any<br />
other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the<br />
Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or<br />
Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new<br />
Database.</p>
<p>"Extraction" – Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a<br />
Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in<br />
any form.</p>
<p>"License" – Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights<br />
such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.</p>
<p>"Licensor" – Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms<br />
of this License.</p>
<p>"Person" – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons<br />
corporate or incorporate.</p>
<p>"Produced Work" –  a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text,<br />
or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the<br />
Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative<br />
Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.</p>
<p>"Publicly" – means to Persons other than You or under Your control by<br />
either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their<br />
activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant).</p>
<p>"Re-utilisation" – means any form of making available to the public all<br />
or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by<br />
renting, by online or other forms of transmission.</p>
<p>"Substantial" – Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a<br />
combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or<br />
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the<br />
Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.</p>
<p>"Use" – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright<br />
or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and<br />
includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing,<br />
publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as<br />
well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it<br />
in a different mode or format.</p>
<p>"You" – Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not<br />
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the<br />
Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to<br />
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.</p>
<p>Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.</p>
<h3>2.0 What this License covers</h3>
<p>2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A license of the Database Right; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.</p>
<p>2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the<br />
Database, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.<br />
  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the<br />
  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents<br />
  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright<br />
  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database<br />
  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation<br />
  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table<br />
  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of<br />
  Contents stored in the Database;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and<br />
  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.<br />
  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed<br />
  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would<br />
  not infringe any applicable copyright; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for<br />
  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of<br />
  use on this access as outlined in this License.</p>
<p>2.3 Rights not covered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making<br />
  or operation of the Database;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the<br />
  Database; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database.</p>
<p>2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of<br />
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,<br />
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality<br />
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database<br />
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.<br />
For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this<br />
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could<br />
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of<br />
the rights over the images.</p>
<h3>3.0 Rights granted</h3>
<p>3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor<br />
grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but<br />
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of<br />
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly<br />
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To<br />
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be<br />
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the<br />
future.</p>
<p>The rights granted cover, for example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of<br />
  the Contents;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Creation of Derivative Databases;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Creation of Collective Databases;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and<br />
  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative<br />
  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or<br />
  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in<br />
  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Databases.</p>
<p>3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br />
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br />
  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves<br />
  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br />
  of the rights granted under this License;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br />
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br />
  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the<br />
  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of<br />
  the rights granted under this License; and,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect<br />
  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is<br />
  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing<br />
  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights<br />
  granted under this License.</p>
<p>3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop<br />
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that<br />
this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice<br />
of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section<br />
10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.</p>
<h3>4.0 Conditions of Use</h3>
<p>4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to<br />
Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important<br />
conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be<br />
in material breach of its terms.</p>
<p>4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative<br />
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You<br />
must:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license<br />
  permitted under Section 4.4;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license<br />
  permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<br />
  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the<br />
  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices<br />
  that refer to this License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular<br />
  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a<br />
  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to<br />
  look for it.</p>
<p>4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced<br />
Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you<br />
Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with<br />
the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,<br />
views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced<br />
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative<br />
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it<br />
is available under this License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under<br />
  Section 4.3:</p>
<pre><code>    Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available
    here under the Open Database License (ODbL).
</code></pre>
<p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a<br />
hyperlink to the URI of the Database. "Open Database License" should<br />
contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If<br />
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the<br />
required URI's with the above notice.</p>
<p>4.4 Share alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under<br />
  the terms of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. This License;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this<br />
      License; or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. A compatible license.</p>
<p>If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses<br />
  mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the<br />
  whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a<br />
  Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works.  A Derivative Database is<br />
  Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work<br />
  created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,<br />
  You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a<br />
  that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine<br />
  compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the<br />
  authorised proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible<br />
  license grants You permission to use the compatible license.</p>
<p>4.5 Limits of Share Alike.  The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply<br />
in the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license<br />
  Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this<br />
  Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License<br />
  still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of<br />
  the Collective Database;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as<br />
  part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not<br />
  create a Derivative Database for purposes of  Section 4.4; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is<br />
  not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements<br />
  of Section 4.4.</p>
<p>4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative<br />
Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also<br />
offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy<br />
in a machine readable form of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The entire Derivative Database; or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or<br />
  the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an<br />
  algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the<br />
  differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.</p>
<p>The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be<br />
available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical<br />
distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.</p>
<p>4.7 Technological measures and additional terms</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to<br />
  Section 4.7 b.)  any terms or any technological measures on the<br />
  Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of<br />
  the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any<br />
  rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting<br />
  the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological<br />
  measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a<br />
  Substantial part of the Contents (a "Restricted Database") in<br />
  contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the<br />
  Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the<br />
  Restricted Database:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. That is available without additional fee;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict<br />
    the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have<br />
    the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to<br />
    exercise those rights (an "Unrestricted Database"); and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the<br />
    recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a<br />
  Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a<br />
  password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You<br />
  do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights<br />
  granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the<br />
  ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>
<p>4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time<br />
You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the<br />
Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the<br />
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same<br />
terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for<br />
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may<br />
enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are<br />
solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made<br />
by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any<br />
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed<br />
under this License.</p>
<h3>5.0 Moral rights</h3>
<p>5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights<br />
to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment<br />
that would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or<br />
any other derogatory treatment:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives<br />
  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest<br />
  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.4;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant<br />
  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral<br />
  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the<br />
  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under<br />
  Section 10.4; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert<br />
  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their<br />
  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.</p>
<p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral<br />
rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some<br />
jurisdictions.</p>
<h3>6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected</h3>
<p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may<br />
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this<br />
Database, including without limitation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents<br />
  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for<br />
  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and<br />
  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative<br />
  or judicial procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation<br />
  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract<br />
and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated<br />
quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including<br />
creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the<br />
Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or<br />
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount<br />
to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the<br />
Contents.</p>
<h3>7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer</h3>
<p>7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any<br />
warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,<br />
custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically<br />
disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,<br />
non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of<br />
errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.<br />
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so<br />
this exclusion may not apply to You.</p>
<h3>8.0 Limitation of liability</h3>
<p>8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,<br />
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability<br />
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use<br />
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused<br />
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of<br />
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,<br />
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,<br />
data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies<br />
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such<br />
damages.</p>
<p>8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and<br />
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on<br />
the part of the Licensor.</p>
<h3>9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License</h3>
<p>9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License<br />
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without<br />
notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the<br />
Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative<br />
Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You<br />
under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided<br />
their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted<br />
under Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will<br />
survive any termination of this License.</p>
<p>9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor<br />
will not terminate Your rights under it.</p>
<p>9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You<br />
for the duration of applicable rights in the Database.</p>
<p>9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and<br />
conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License<br />
will be reinstated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th<br />
  day after cessation of breach;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless<br />
  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the<br />
  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of<br />
  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the<br />
  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to<br />
be a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.</p>
<p>9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release<br />
the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or<br />
making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different<br />
license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not<br />
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br />
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br />
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br />
stated above.</p>
<h3>10.0 General</h3>
<p>10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or<br />
unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of<br />
the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each<br />
remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the<br />
fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with<br />
respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any<br />
