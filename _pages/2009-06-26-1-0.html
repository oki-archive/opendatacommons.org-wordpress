<h2>ODC Database Contents License (DbCL)</h2>
<p>The Licensor and You agree as follows:</p>
<h3>1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words</h3>
<p>The definitions of the Open Database License (ODbL) 1.0 are incorporated<br />
by reference into the Database Contents License.</p>
<h3>2.0 Rights granted and Conditions of Use</h3>
<p>2.1 Rights granted. The Licensor grants to You a worldwide,<br />
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable copyright license to<br />
do any act that is restricted by copyright over anything within the<br />
Contents, whether in the original medium or any other. These rights<br />
explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of<br />
endeavour.  These rights include, without limitation, the right to<br />
sublicense the work.</p>
<p>2.2 Conditions of Use. You must comply with the ODbL.</p>
<p>2.3 Relationship to Databases and ODbL. This license does not cover any<br />
Database Rights, Database copyright, or contract over the Contents as<br />
part of the Database. Please see the ODbL covering the Database for more<br />
details about Your rights and obligations.</p>
<p>2.4 Non-assertion of copyright over facts. The Licensor takes the<br />
position that factual information is not covered by copyright. The DbCL<br />
grants you permission for any information having copyright contained in<br />
the Contents.</p>
<h3>3.0 Warranties, disclaimer, and limitation of liability</h3>
<p>3.1 The Contents are licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any<br />
warranty of any kind, either express or implied, whether of title, of<br />
accuracy, of the presence of absence of errors, of fitness for purpose,<br />
or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied<br />
warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.</p>
<p>3.2 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,<br />
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability<br />
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use<br />
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused<br />
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of<br />
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,<br />
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages. This exclusion applies<br />
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such<br />
damages.</p>
<p>3.3 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and<br />
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on<br />
the part of the Licensor.</p>
