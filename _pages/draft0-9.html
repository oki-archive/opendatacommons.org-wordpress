<h2>ODC Attribution License (ODC-By)</h2>
<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement<br />
intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Data(base)<br />
subject only to the attribution requirements set out in section 4.</p>
<p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,<br />
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),<br />
and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not<br />
the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish<br />
to use this license together with another license for the contents.</p>
<p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be<br />
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,<br />
trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights<br />
over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may<br />
have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing<br />
activities not covered by this License.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Licensor (as defined below)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You (as defined below)</p>
<p>agree as follows:</p>
<h3>1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words</h3>
<p>"Collective Database" – Means this Database in unmodified form as part<br />
of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are<br />
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective<br />
Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.</p>
<p>"Convey" – As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,<br />
or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables<br />
a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative<br />
Database.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a<br />
computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no<br />
transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.</p>
<p>"Contents" – The contents of this Database, which includes the<br />
information, independent works, or other material collected into the<br />
Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual<br />
data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.</p>
<p>"Database" – A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a<br />
systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic<br />
or other means offered under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>"Database Directive" – Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European<br />
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection<br />
of databases, as amended or succeeded.</p>
<p>"Database Right" – Means rights resulting from the Chapter III ("sui<br />
generis") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed<br />
by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of<br />
the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar<br />
rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.</p>
<p>"Derivative Database" – Means a database based upon the Database, and<br />
includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any<br />
other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the<br />
Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or<br />
Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new<br />
Database.</p>
<p>"Extraction" – Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a<br />
Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in<br />
any form.</p>
<p>"License" – Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights<br />
such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.</p>
<p>"Licensor" – Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms<br />
of this License.</p>
<p>"Person" – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons<br />
corporate or incorporate.</p>

Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.</p>
<p>"Publicly" – means to Persons other than You or under Your control by<br />

or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by<br />
renting, by online or other forms of transmission.</p>
<p>"Substantial" – Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a<br />

Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the<br />
Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.</p>
<p>"Use" – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright<br />
or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and<br />
includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing,<br />

well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it<br />
in a different mode or format.</p>
<p>"You" – Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not<br />
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the<br />
Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to<br />

<h3>2.0 What this License covers</h3>
<p>2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:</p>
<p>a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;</p>
<p>b. A license of the Database Right; and</p>
<p>c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.</p>
<p>2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the<br />
Database, including:</p>
<p>a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.<br />
  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the<br />
  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents<br />
  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright<br />
  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database<br />
  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation<br />
  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table<br />
  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of<br />
  Contents stored in the Database;</p>
<p>b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and<br />
  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.<br />
  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the<br />
  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed<br />
  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would<br />
  not infringe any applicable copyright; and</p>
<p>c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for<br />
  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of<br />
  use on this access as outlined in this License.</p>
<p>2.3 Rights not covered.</p>
<p>a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making<br />
  or operation of the Database;</p>
<p>b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the<br />
  Database; and</p>
<p>c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the<br />
  Database.</p>
<p>2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of<br />
the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,<br />
including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality<br />
rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database<br />
Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.<br />
For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this<br />
License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could<br />
have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of<br />
the rights over the images.</p>
<h3>3.0 Rights granted</h3>
<p>3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor<br />
grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but<br />
only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of<br />
any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly<br />
include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To<br />
the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be<br />
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the<br />
future.</p>
<p>The rights granted cover, for example:</p>
<p>a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of<br />
  the Contents;</p>
<p>b. Creation of Derivative Databases;</p>
<p>c. Creation of Collective Databases;</p>
<p>d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and<br />
  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative<br />
  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and</p>
<p>e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or<br />
  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in<br />
  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective<br />
  Databases.</p>
<p>3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
<p>a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br />
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br />
  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves<br />
  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br />
  of the rights granted under this License;</p>
<p>b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br />
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br />
  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the<br />
  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of<br />
  the rights granted under this License; and,</p>
<p>c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect<br />
  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is<br />
  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing<br />
  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights<br />
  granted under this License.</p>
<p>3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop<br />
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that<br />
this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice<br />
of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section<br />
10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.</p>
<h3>4.0 Conditions of Use</h3>
<p>4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to<br />
Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important<br />
conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be<br />
in material breach of its terms.</p>
<p>4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative<br />
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You<br />
must:</p>
<p>a. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<br />
  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the<br />
  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and</p>
<p>b. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices<br />
  that refer to this License.</p>
<p>c. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular<br />
  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a<br />
  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to<br />
  look for it.</p>
<p>4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced<br />
Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you<br />
Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with<br />
the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,<br />
views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced<br />
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative<br />
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it<br />
is available under this License.</p>
<p>a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under<br />
  Section 4.3:</p>
<pre><code>    Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available
    under the ODC Attribution License.
</code></pre>
<p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a<br />
hyperlink to the location of the Database. "ODC Attribution License"<br />
should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If<br />
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the<br />
required URI's with the above notice.</p>
<h3>5.0 Moral rights</h3>
<p>5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights<br />
to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment<br />
that would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or<br />
any other derogatory treatment:</p>
<p>a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives<br />
  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest<br />
  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section<br />
  10.4;</p>
<p>b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant<br />
  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral<br />
  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the<br />
  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under<br />
  Section 10.4; and</p>
<p>c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert<br />
  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their<br />
  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.</p>
<p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral<br />
rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some<br />
jurisdictions.</p>
<h3>6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected</h3>
<p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may<br />
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this<br />
Database, including without limitation:</p>
<p>a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents<br />
  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for<br />
  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and<br />
  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative<br />
  or judicial procedure.</p>
<p>b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation<br />
  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract<br />
and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated<br />
quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including<br />
creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the<br />
Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or<br />
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount<br />
to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the<br />
Contents.</p>
<h3>7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer</h3>
<p>7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any<br />
warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,<br />
custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically<br />
disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,<br />
non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of<br />
errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.<br />
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so<br />
this exclusion may not apply to You.</p>
<h3>8.0 Limitation of liability</h3>
<p>8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,<br />
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability<br />
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use<br />
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused<br />
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of<br />
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,<br />
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,<br />
data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies<br />
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such<br />
damages.</p>
<p>8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and<br />
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on<br />
the part of the Licensor.</p>
<h3>9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License</h3>
<p>9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License<br />
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without<br />
notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the<br />
Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative<br />
Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You<br />
under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided<br />
their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted<br />
under Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will<br />
survive any termination of this License.</p>
<p>9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor<br />
will not terminate Your rights under it.</p>
<p>9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You<br />
for the duration of applicable rights in the Database.</p>
<p>9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and<br />
conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License<br />
will be reinstated:</p>
<p>a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th<br />
  day after cessation of breach;</p>
<p>b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless<br />
  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or</p>
<p>c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the<br />
  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of<br />
  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the<br />
  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release<br />
the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or<br />
making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different<br />
license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not<br />
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br />
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br />
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br />
stated above.</p>
<h3>10.0 General</h3>
<p>10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or<br />
unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of<br />
the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each<br />
remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the<br />
fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with<br />
respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any<br />
earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to<br />
the Database.</p>
<p>10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be<br />
entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any<br />
breach by the Licensor.</p>
<p>10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by<br />
the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are<br />
sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under<br />
applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant<br />
jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,<br />
these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the<br />
terms of this License.</p>
